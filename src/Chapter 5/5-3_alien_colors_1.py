#Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green' , 'yellow' , or 'red'.

#Write an if statement to test whether the alien's color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
#Write a version of the program that fails and one that passes.
