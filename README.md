# Python Practice

## Repository for me to store my practice programs and coursework as I teach myself Python and work through Python Crash Course.


### Chapter 2

#### 2.1 Simple Message
The first "Hello World type program"

```python
message = "This is a simple message. Hurray!"
print(message)
```

This first program will print the message. `message = ` will set whatever string literal to the variable "message" which is then called by `print(message)` resulting in the following output:

>This is a simple message. Hurray!


#### 2.1 Simple Messages

This code shows a simple cocatenation of two separate messages I've made.
this time we have a `message` and a `message2` you can combine the outputs of these two separate variables by doing `print(message + message2)`

```python
#Simple hello message
message = "Oh Hello there!  "
print (message)
message2 = "This is concatenation"
print(message + message2)
```
The code above results in the following output:

>Oh Hello there! This is concatenation


#### 2.1 Personal Message




#### 2.8 Numbers
